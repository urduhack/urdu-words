Consists of text files containing 150k+ Urdu words for all your dictionary/word-based projects e.g: auto-completion / autosuggestion / Embedding networks / Tagging
## Files you may be interested in:

I pulled out the words into a simple new-line-delimited text file.
Which is more useful when building apps or importing into databases etc.

-  [words.txt](words.txt) Contains all urdu words.
-  [bigram_words.txt](bigram_words.txt) Contains all urdu bigram words.
-  [trigram_words.txt](trigram_words.txt) Contains all urdu trigram words.

## NER Labels
I have added words for labelling Named Entity Recognition(NER) Data. These labels contain words related to different categories
like _Persons_, _Locations_, _Organizations_ and _Dates_ etc. These words give a good starting point for labelling NER data.
Below are the files containing different label words.

- [locations.txt](ner/locations.txt) Contains locations from across the world
- [persons.txt](ner/persons.txt) Contains Person Names
- [organizations.txt](ner/organizations.txt) Contains Organization names
- [dates.txt](ner/dates.txt) Contains time and date related words
